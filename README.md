## risk.
This project's code has been audited, and we've put a great deal of care into designing the system in the most secure way possible. Even so, there is always a risk of loss of funds when interacting with the included code due to security bugs or mechanism failures.

This project is an experiment. We appreciate those willing to help us test this novel mechanism, but please take time to understand the risks involved before doing so.
